# Breast-Cancer-Classifier
We analysed the BreastCancer data set from Wisconsin, which consists of nine characteristics of breast tissue sample using the fine needle aspiration cytology. Three classifiers have been built to help classify a tissue sample into two categories, benign or malignant:
* Logistic Regression with Best Subset Selection
* Lasso Regression
* Bayes Classifier for Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

To assess their predictive performance, cross-validation has been applied to the three models. From the average test error, we can then deduce the “best” classifier.
